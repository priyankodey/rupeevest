                        <p>When you invest money with RupeeVest, you invest in up to 12 different asset classes ranging from aggressive equities to highly conservative debt investments this helps to optimize asset allocation.</p>
                        <p>Investment in Equities is progressively increased depending on an individualâ€™s risk taking capabilities to enhance potential return with a slightly higher risk. Lower risk portfolios comprise of more liquid or debt investments which provide more consistent returns.</p>

                    <h1>How we picked our funds</h1>
                        <p>Each Mutual Fund has been selected to balance considerations of low cost and high liquidity as a means to access each asset class. When making the selection for each Fund, we considered the following: expense ratio, historical return. We emphasis on funds by the best fund managers, ensure that it has the right portfolio of assets and its capital gains implication.</p>
